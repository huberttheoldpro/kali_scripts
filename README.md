# kali_scripts
all these scripts have to be turned into executables and will likely only work on kali linux unless you install the apps used idk if that is possible but do whatevs
command to turn into executables: chmod +x /path/to/where/the/script/is/saved
I hold no accountability from the use of any of these scripts, use of these scripts is highly ilegal if not done within controlled conditions with expressed permissions from owners of the devices in wustion and/or isps if it is a wifi related script
